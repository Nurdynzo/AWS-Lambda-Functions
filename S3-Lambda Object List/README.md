This is a Lambda function that returns a list of objects in an S3 bucket with a link to each object.

The function uses the Boto3 S3 resource to connect to an S3 bucket named prod-live-lessons. It then retrieves a list of objects in the bucket using the my_bucket.objects.all() method.

For each object in the bucket, the function constructs a link to the object using the get_bucket_url function, which takes the bucket name and object key as input. The get_bucket_url function constructs a URL to the object using the format https://ll-videos.ulesson.com/<object_key>.

Finally, the function constructs a list of objects in the bucket with their corresponding links and returns it as a JSON response with a 200 status code. If an error occurs while accessing the S3 bucket, the function logs the error and returns a 500 status code.
