This is a Python code for a Lambda function that listens to an SNS topic for a specific alert type related to unauthorized network access to an EC2 instance. When the alert is triggered, the Lambda function creates a new network ACL entry to deny traffic from the offending IP address.

The code first imports the necessary modules: json, boto3 (AWS SDK for Python), and os. It then creates a client object for EC2 using boto3.client().

The function lambda_handler(event, context) is defined to handle incoming events from the SNS topic. The function extracts the message content from the event and loads it as a JSON object using json.loads(). It then checks if the alert type contains the string "unauthorized". If it does, the function extracts the offending IP address and VPC ID from the message payload.

The function then uses the describe_network_acls() method of the EC2 client to get the details of the network ACLs in the VPC. It filters the results based on the VPC ID and selects the first network ACL. It then iterates over the entries in the selected network ACL to find the last rule number. It uses the create_network_acl_entry() method of the EC2 client to create a new network ACL entry to deny traffic from the offending IP address.

The function returns no value, as it is intended to be used as an event handler for the SNS topic.
